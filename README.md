# Data-Manager
Binary file database system - in progress

CPP library for data handling. Idea is to provide simple solutions for writing, editing and reading data from binary data file based on B+ tree. Implementation will be improved version of existing system implemented in retro expense manager project, which had linked lists as data structure. 
Challenge to overcome: implementation of generalized class serialization and deserialization functions. (implementation of the upcoming C++20 reflection)  or if not yet possible to overcome, provide elegant functions to serialize different data based on primitive data types.
